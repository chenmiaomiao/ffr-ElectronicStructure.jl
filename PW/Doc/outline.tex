\section{Outline}

First, I will describe the top level description about what
the a typical electronic structure calculation based on density functional
theory is carried out. After that, I will break it apart into
smaller pieces which are hopefully easier to implement and be understood.

In a typical DFT calculation we are trying to solve the so-called Kohn-Sham
equations:
\begin{equation}
H_{KS} \psi_{KS} = e_{KS} \psi_{KS}
\end{equation}
