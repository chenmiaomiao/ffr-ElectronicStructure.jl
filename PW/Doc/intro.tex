\section{Outline}

First, I will describe the top level description about what
the a typical electronic structure calculation based on density functional
theory is carried out. After that, I will break it apart into
smaller pieces which are hopefully easier to implement and be understood.

In a typical DFT calculation we are trying to solve the so-called Kohn-Sham
equations:
\begin{equation}
H_{KS} \psi_{KS} = e_{KS} \psi_{KS}
\end{equation}

Tasks:
\begin{itemize}
\item Setting up data structure for PW basis set
\item Solving Poisson equation using FFT
\item Solving Schrodinger equation: diagonalization, energy minimization
\item Solving KS equation: SCF and energy minimzation
\end{itemize}
