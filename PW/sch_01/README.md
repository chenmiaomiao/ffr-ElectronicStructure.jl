# Solving Schrodinger equation

This directory contains codes to solve Schrodinger equation with
harmonic potential, using plane wave basis set.

There are two methods:

- total energy minimization: steepest descent and conjugate gradient
- diagonalization, using locally-optimal block preconditioned conjugate
  gradient (by Knyazev)

FIXME: It does not work yet for bare Coulomb potential.
