# ffr-ElectronicStructure.jl

Simple electronic structure calculations implemented in
Julia programming language.

Many of the codes here are inspired from [Prof. Tomas Arias' Practical DFT course](http://jdftx.org/PracticalDFT.html)
especially the example problem for Poisson equation and minimization algorithms.

## TODO

- Numerical methods:
  - minimization (SD and CG)
  - iterative diagonalization: Lanczos, band-by-band CG, Davidson, and LOBPCG

- Longer term: Finite difference, Lagrange basis, and Gaussian basis
